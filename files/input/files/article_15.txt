Owner of Kansas Medical Staffing Company Indicted in Employment Tax Scheme

Thursday, April 12, 2018

A federal grand jury sitting in Kansas City, Kansas, returned an indictment, which was unsealed
yesterday, charging a Jefferson County, Kansas, man with seven counts of willful failure to pay
over employment taxes to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), announced Principal Deputy Assistant
Attorney General Richard E. Zuckerman of the Justice Department's Tax Division and U.S. Attorney
Stephen McAllister for the District of Kansas.

According to the indictment, David Monhollon failed to pay over federal income, Social Security,
and Medicare taxes withheld from the wages paid to employees of his medical staffing company,
First Call Medical Group.   The indictment alleges that Monhollon was the owner of First Call and
was obligated to pay over to the IRS such payroll taxes on behalf of his company.   Instead of
remitting the money to the IRS, Monhollon allegedly used the funds to pay for personal expenses
including racecar parts and equipment.    

If convicted, the defendant faces a statutory maximum sentence of five years in prison for each
count.   He also faces a period of supervised release, restitution, and monetary penalties.   An
indictment merely alleges that crimes have been committed.   A defendant is presumed innocent
until proven guilty.

Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Zuckerman and U.S. Attorney McAllister commended
special agents of IRS Criminal Investigation, who investigated the case, and Assistant U.S.
Attorney Leon Patton and Tax Division Trial Attorney John Mulcahy, who are prosecuting the case.
